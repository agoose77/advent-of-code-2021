# advent-of-code-2021
The [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is 
> [...] an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

These are my Python solutions. I won't be adding unit tests, because at the end of the day, I want to enjoy this process /s
But, seriously - that's too much time for something this small :)
